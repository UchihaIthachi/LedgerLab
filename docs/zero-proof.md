# Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) Explained

A Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) is a fascinating cryptographic method where one party (the Prover) can prove to another party (the Verifier) that a specific statement is true, without revealing any information beyond the validity of the statement itself. The Verifier learns nothing about the secret knowledge the Prover possesses.

## Core Concepts

Imagine Alice wants to be sure that Bob knows a secret (e.g., the solution to a puzzle), but Bob doesn't want to reveal the secret itself because Alice might then use it without rewarding Bob. ZKPs solve this dilemma.

Key properties of a ZKP:

1.  **Completeness:** If the statement is true, an honest Prover can convince an honest Verifier.
2.  **Soundness:** If the statement is false, a cheating Prover cannot convince an honest Verifier that it is true (except with a very small probability).
3.  **Zero-Knowledge:** If the statement is true, the Verifier learns nothing more than the fact that the statement is true. They don't learn the secret information itself.

## The Map Coloring Analogy (Graph Three-Colorability)

A classic example used to explain ZKPs is the "Graph Three-Colorability" problem, which this project demonstrates using a map of the United States and four colors.

*   **The Problem (Prover's Secret):** Bob (the Prover) claims he can color a map (graph) using only a few colors (e.g., four) such that no two regions (states) that share a common border have the same color. This valid coloring is Bob's secret.
*   **The Goal:** Bob wants to prove to Alice (the Verifier) that he has such a valid coloring, but he doesn't want to show her the actual colored map, because she could then copy it.

## How This Project Illustrates ZKP (Alice & Bob's Protocol)

The "Zero Knowledge" section of this demo ([/zero-proof](http://localhost:3000/zero-proof)) simulates this:

1.  **Initial State (Hidden Solution):**
    *   The demo starts with a map of the USA, with all states uncolored (white). This represents Bob having his correctly colored map solution but keeping it hidden. The underlying correct coloring is stored in the JavaScript code (`map.mapData.paths[key].color` for each state `key`).

2.  **Alice's Challenge (Picking States):**
    *   Alice (the user) can click on any two states on the map.
    *   When two states are selected, only those two states are revealed with their "true" colors from Bob's solution. All other states remain white.
    *   Alice's goal is to pick two states that share a border. If Bob's solution is valid, these two states *must* have different colors.

3.  **Bob's Response & Commitment Shuffling:**
    *   After Alice sees the colors of the two states she picked, the map resets (the selected states become white again).
    *   Crucially, before Alice's next challenge, Bob (the demo) can "shuffle" the colors using the `Shuffle Colors` button.
        *   What this does: The underlying *logic* of which state gets which color index (e.g., State X is "Color 1", State Y is "Color 2") remains the same. However, the actual *appearance* of "Color 1" (e.g., Red, Blue, Green, or Yellow) is randomly changed via an `offset` in the JavaScript.
        *   So, in one round, "Color 1" might be Red. After shuffling, "Color 1" might now be Blue.
    *   This shuffling is the **zero-knowledge** part. Alice sees that adjacent states are different, but she cannot build up a picture of the *entire* colored map because the specific color of any given state changes from her perspective between rounds.

4.  **Iteration and Confidence Building:**
    *   Alice repeats the process: pick two adjacent states, observe their colors (they should be different), then Bob shuffles.
    *   Each time Alice successfully challenges Bob and finds that adjacent states have different colors, her confidence that Bob *does* indeed possess a valid coloring increases.
    *   If Bob were cheating (didn't have a valid coloring), there would be a chance Alice would eventually pick two adjacent states that have the same color, exposing his deception. The more rounds they do successfully, the lower this probability becomes.

5.  **The Proof:**
    *   After many rounds, Alice becomes probabilistically convinced that Bob has a valid solution, even though she has not seen the whole solution at once in a consistent, copyable form. She only learns that Bob can consistently meet her challenges.

6.  **Revealing the Solution (Optional):**
    *   The `Show Colors` button in the demo reveals the entire colored map. In a real ZKP scenario, this might happen *after* the proof is accepted and, for example, Alice pays Bob. The ZKP itself is about proving possession of the knowledge without this final reveal.

## How This Project Illustrates Zero-Knowledge Proofs

*   **Interactive Challenge-Response:** The user (Alice) actively participates by selecting states.
*   **Visualizing "Hidden" Knowledge:** The initially white map and the selective reveal represents Bob's hidden solution.
*   **Demonstrating Color Shuffling:** The "Shuffle Colors" button is key to making the "zero-knowledge" aspect tangible. It shows how the Prover can change the *representation* of their secret between interactions to prevent the Verifier from learning the secret itself.
*   **Intuitive Confidence Building:** While not formally quantified, the repetitive process implies that confidence grows with each successful verification round.

This demo provides a simplified but effective way to grasp the core idea of proving knowledge without revealing the underlying confidential information, which is the essence of Zero-Knowledge Proofs.

00:00:01.199 Hi, this is Anders Brownworth. This is a
00:00:04.240 demonstration of the concept behind zero
00:00:07.279 knowledge proofs. A zero knowledge proof
00:00:10.480 is a proof that something is true while
00:00:14.160 revealing zero other knowledge about it.
00:00:18.240 And we're going to do this with a
00:00:19.840 demonstration. This is Alice's map of
00:00:22.960 the United States. And as you can tell,
00:00:25.519 each of the states are represented here.
00:00:27.599 and she wants to color this map such
00:00:29.760 that no two states that share a border
00:00:33.840 are colored the same
00:00:35.719 color. And it turns out that you can do
00:00:39.040 that with just four colors. And Bob has
00:00:43.680 an answer. Here it is right here. You
00:00:46.719 can tell no two states that share a
00:00:49.280 border are of the same color. And it
00:00:51.280 works. You can see that the borders are
00:00:53.199 very easy to see because the colors are
00:00:55.440 all different. and and this is a good
00:00:57.280 solution. So, we're done, right? Alice
00:00:59.520 has a need. Bob has the answer. Alice
00:01:02.160 pays Bob. We're good, right? Well, not
00:01:06.520 really. If Alice were to simply trust
00:01:10.479 that Bob has the answer and pay him and
00:01:14.400 then Bob doesn't have the answer, well,
00:01:16.320 now Alice is out her money. Or if in an
00:01:20.159 effort to convince Alice that Bob has
00:01:23.040 the right answer, Bob just shows the
00:01:25.080 answer. Well, Alice could just steal the
00:01:27.600 answer and never pay for it. So, how do
00:01:30.720 we fix this? Well, zero knowledge proofs
00:01:34.400 can help us here. So, how how do we make
00:01:37.680 this work? So, Bob takes his answer and
00:01:40.880 he puts it up on the wall in a room. And
00:01:42.880 of course, he hides it because he
00:01:44.479 doesn't want to just show Alice all the
00:01:46.640 answers. So he invites Alice in and
00:01:50.880 says, "Alice, go ahead and pick any two
00:01:54.000 states that you like that share a border
00:01:57.439 and I will reveal the colors behind
00:01:59.759 them." So Alice randomly picks this one
00:02:03.200 and this one. And sure enough, they are
00:02:06.880 of different colors. And so then she
00:02:09.520 leaves the room. And then Bob reveals
00:02:13.040 the colors and he does something
00:02:15.520 interesting. He shuffles them. Now, this
00:02:19.200 is exactly the same solution and we're
00:02:22.160 using exactly the same four colors. It's
00:02:25.120 just that we've swapped one for another
00:02:27.920 somewhat
00:02:28.840 randomly. Okay. So, then he hides the
00:02:32.480 colors again and he invites Alice back
00:02:34.879 in. He says again, "Alice, pick any two
00:02:37.760 states that share a border and I will
00:02:40.720 reveal the color behind them." And this
00:02:42.400 time, she randomly picks this one and
00:02:44.560 this one. And sure enough, she notes
00:02:47.599 that they are of different colors. And
00:02:50.480 then she leaves the room again. And
00:02:52.319 again, we do exactly the same thing. We
00:02:54.480 shuffle to another set of colors. And
00:02:56.879 then we hide them. And then she comes
00:02:59.120 in. And this time, she picks a whole
00:03:01.040 different set. And we we do this over
00:03:03.280 and over and over and over
00:03:06.040 again. Over time, Alice is gaining more
00:03:10.319 and more confidence that Bob must have
00:03:13.760 the right answer. But she's not learning
00:03:16.480 anything else about the
00:03:18.280 map. After a while, let's say after a
00:03:22.720 few thousand
00:03:24.440 iterations, Alice has a lot of
00:03:27.599 confidence that Bob has the right answer
00:03:30.080 here. There's less than a one ina-
00:03:32.480 million chance that he has the wrong
00:03:34.599 answer. So, her confidence has grown so
00:03:38.239 high now that she's willing to pay Bob
00:03:41.840 for the answer. And then finally when
00:03:44.239 when it's all done, finally he reveals
00:03:48.720 the answer to her and then she uh she
00:03:51.200 can get the full answer. Now let's think
00:03:53.680 about this uh a little bit. What what's
00:03:56.080 really happening here? Well, remember I
00:03:58.920 said the two states must share a border.
00:04:03.519 Well, I said that because like for
00:04:05.360 example, if she were to pick this one
00:04:07.200 and some other one that doesn't
00:04:08.720 shareboard like this one, oh my
00:04:11.200 goodness, we would leak some
00:04:12.640 information. We would now know that when
00:04:14.799 this one is this color, this one also is
00:04:17.199 this color. We would gain some global
00:04:20.160 information about this map. wherein when
00:04:22.960 we were doing it before, when you had to
00:04:25.520 pick something that shared a border,
00:04:27.199 you'll only ever get local information
00:04:30.400 and you'll never gain any more
00:04:32.560 information about the map. And in this
00:04:35.280 way, Bob has confidence that Alice can't
00:04:39.040 learn anything aside from the thing that
00:04:41.360 he wants her to learn, which is that he
00:04:43.600 has the right answer. And Alice, no
00:04:45.680 matter how much she does it, can't learn
00:04:47.520 anything globally about all the colors
00:04:49.440 in the map because she's constrained to
00:04:51.440 only pick states that share a border and
00:04:54.720 she's only allowed to look at two at a
00:04:56.800 time. And that is intuitively how zero
00:05:01.040 knowledge proofs uh can be applied and
00:05:04.160 how they help us uh in these situations.
00:05:07.199 Thanks for watching.
