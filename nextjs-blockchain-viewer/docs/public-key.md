# Public-Key Cryptography and Digital Signatures Explained

Public-key cryptography is a system that uses a pair of keys: a **public key**, which can be shared with anyone, and a **private key**, which must be kept secret by its owner. What one key encrypts, only the other can decrypt. This system is fundamental to securing communications and verifying authenticity in the digital world, including blockchains.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Key Pairs (Private and Public Keys)

*   **Theory:**
    *   **Private Key:** A large, randomly generated secret number. It's the "master key" that its owner must protect.
    *   **Public Key:** Mathematically derived from the private key. It's designed so that it's computationally infeasible to figure out the private key from the public key. The public key can be freely distributed.
    *   In blockchain, your public key often acts as your address (or the basis for it) â€“ it's where others can send you funds. Your private key is what gives you control over those funds.
*   **Project Illustration:**
    *   The "Keys" section of the demo ([/keys](http://localhost:3000/public-private-key/keys)) demonstrates this relationship.
    *   You can manually enter a (very large) number as a `Private Key` or click the `Random` button to generate one.
    *   The corresponding `Public Key` is instantly calculated and displayed. This uses elliptic curve cryptography (specifically `secp256k1`, the same used in Bitcoin) via the `elliptic.js` library.
    *   This page visually reinforces that the public key is derived from, and linked to, the private key.

### 2. Digital Signatures

*   **Theory:** A digital signature is a cryptographic mechanism used to verify the authenticity and integrity of digital data. It provides:
    *   **Authentication:** Proof that the message was created by a known sender (the one who possesses the corresponding private key).
    *   **Integrity:** Proof that the message has not been altered since it was signed.
    *   **Non-repudiation:** The sender cannot later deny having sent the message.
    *   The process generally involves:
        1.  Hashing the message to create a fixed-size digest.
        2.  Encrypting this hash with the sender's **private key**. This encrypted hash is the digital signature.
*   **Project Illustration:**
    *   The "Signatures" section ([/signatures](http://localhost:3000/public-private-key/signatures)) in the "Sign" tab allows you to create a digital signature:
        1.  You type a `Message`.
        2.  Your `Private Key` (from the "Keys" section or cookies) is used.
        3.  Clicking `Sign` first hashes the message (using SHA-256) and then uses the private key to create the `Message Signature`.
    *   This demonstrates how a unique signature is tied to both the message content and the specific private key used.

### 3. Signature Verification

*   **Theory:** To verify a digital signature:
    1.  The recipient uses the sender's **public key** to decrypt the signature, revealing the original hash (digest).
    2.  The recipient independently hashes the received message using the same hash function.
    3.  If the two hashes match, the signature is valid. This confirms the sender's identity (authentication) and that the message hasn't been tampered with (integrity).
*   **Project Illustration:**
    *   In the "Signatures" section, the "Verify" tab demonstrates this:
        1.  You provide the `Message`, the sender's `Public Key`, and the `Signature`.
        2.  Clicking `Verify` uses the provided public key to check the signature against the hash of the message.
        3.  The UI indicates success (green background) or failure (red background), showing whether the signature is valid for that message and public key.
        4.  If you change even one character in the message or the signature, verification will fail, highlighting the integrity aspect.

### 4. Application in Blockchain Transactions

*   **Theory:** In a blockchain like Bitcoin, when you want to send cryptocurrency, you create a transaction message (e.g., "Send 0.5 BTC from Address A (your public key/address) to Address B"). You then sign this transaction message with your **private key**. This signature proves that you, the owner of the funds at Address A, authorize this transfer. Miners and other nodes on the network can then use your public key to verify the signature before including the transaction in a block. Without a valid signature, the transaction is rejected.
*   **Project Illustration:**
    *   The "Transaction" section ([/transaction](http://localhost:3000/public-private-key/transaction)) simulates this:
        *   The "Message" is structured as a transaction: `Amount`, `From` (your public key, automatically filled), and `To` (recipient's public key/address).
        *   You `Sign` this transaction data using your `Private Key`.
        *   In the "Verify" tab, the system uses the `From` public key to validate the signature for the transaction details. The `From` field is highlighted, indicating it's the public key against which verification occurs.
        *   This clearly shows that only the person holding the private key corresponding to the "From" address can authorize the spending of funds from that address.

## How This Project Illustrates Public-Key Cryptography

This demo provides a clear, interactive way to understand:

*   **Key Pair Dynamics:** The direct link between a secret private key and a shareable public key.
*   **The Signing Process:** How a private key is used to create a unique signature for specific data.
*   **The Verification Process:** How a public key can confirm the authenticity and integrity of a signed message without needing the private key.
*   **Relevance to Blockchains:** How these cryptographic primitives are essential for securing transactions and ensuring that only legitimate owners can transfer assets.

By experimenting with generating keys, signing messages/transactions, and verifying them (and seeing verifications fail when data is altered), users can grasp the fundamental security model that underpins blockchain technology.

# https://www.youtube.com/watch/xIDL_akeras

00:00:01.180 Welcome back
00:00:02.379 Last time we looked at a blockchain, and how it works
00:00:06.339 particularly in the financial context
00:00:08.400 and we have these transactions that we were creating that move money from one person to another but there's a
00:00:14.830 big problem with this and that is what's to stop somebody from just adding a
00:00:20.650 Transaction that spends all of someone else's money to them
00:00:25.630 There's seems to be no
00:00:27.939 Protection here for that so what we're gonna do is we're gonna look at ways to add
00:00:33.460 transactions to a blockchain
00:00:35.380 that
00:00:36.610 Keep it. So not just anyone can create these transactions in order to do this. We need to look at
00:00:44.289 another cryptographic primitive and that is
00:00:48.010 Public private key pairs, and then we'll use that for signatures, so let's take a look at that right now
00:00:54.129 so here's a
00:00:55.570 public/private key pair
00:00:57.430 The private key here
00:00:59.370 It's just you know
00:01:00.210 It's a really really long number and any number is a private key right you could
00:01:05.170 Make this be one one is a private key
00:01:07.380 It's not a very good one lots of people have thought of the number one before
00:01:11.200 but you could you know you could pick some really really long number and it's sort of a random number and
00:01:17.950 We can use that as a private key. Now. You can see every time. I'm adding digits here its
00:01:24.009 Recomputing the public key that relates to that private key, and that's why the stuff down
00:01:29.049 Here starts changing so as the name would imply this
00:01:34.720 Private key is to be kept private only you have this private key, and you never tell it to anyone else
00:01:41.790 Okay, and just as the name implies
00:01:45.579 Public key the public key here, you just tell everyone this is something that you want everybody to know
00:01:52.390 This is something that there's no harm in letting everyone know
00:01:57.250 There is not a way to derive from this public key
00:02:00.990 What the private key is okay? So it's just a kind of a public
00:02:06.729 Version of this private key that does not reveal what the private key is
00:02:11.319 Okay, so I'm gonna hit my little ray number generator, so I get a nice really long private key
00:02:16.629 And it's not something you know where the numbers are close together where I typed
00:02:20.450 On the keyboard it's something a little bit more random looking and then the system has derived a public key
00:02:26.930 From this so this is going to be my private key, and I'm gonna use this to do signatures
00:02:31.609 So let's do that right now, so
00:02:34.790 Here's a message signature
00:02:37.340 So here is a message. I'm gonna type. You know hello on ders. That's me
00:02:43.700 and I have
00:02:46.549 My private key here six five six whatever it is is my private key only
00:02:51.069 I have that and here's the message that only I have
00:02:54.829 And I can hit sign and come up with a message signature here now this message
00:03:02.030 Signature I can pass to someone else
00:03:05.469 I'm gonna hit my little verify button I'm gonna pass this message signature to someone else to anybody else okay
00:03:11.290 now of course they don't have my private key because I keep that private nobody else can see that but I
00:03:18.769 Publicize my public key, and they know that everybody knows that this is my public key
00:03:23.690 So given this message and everybody knows my public key and given the signature that I just made
00:03:30.349 You should be able to verify this now of course if I hit verify sure enough the screen goes green
00:03:36.199 This is a valid message
00:03:37.599 And I have verified that whoever signed this message and came up with a signal
00:03:44.689 Signature had access to the private key behind this public key
00:03:50.449 Okay, and if I have kept that private key secret that must be me okay
00:03:56.629 So that's a message signature
00:03:58.750 And how you can sign something and verify it now instead of just using this freeform text box
00:04:04.970 Let's put some structure around this. I'm gonna make a transaction here instead all right. This is similar to what we saw before
00:04:13.340 the message I'm gonna say is I'm gonna send twenty dollars from this happens to be my
00:04:21.798 public key to
00:04:24.020 Somebody else's public key whoever whoever this is that I'm sending money to okay? I
00:04:30.080 Of course because I'm Simon smashes. I have my private key
00:04:33.670 I never tell anybody the private key, but I can use this private key to sign this message
00:04:38.530 Which consists of these three things up here?
00:04:41.540 And if I hit sign I get a message signature great all right now
00:04:46.540 I send this whole thing out I send out my message and my signature to to
00:04:53.000 somebody else and
00:04:55.100 They know that I'm trying to send twenty dollars from my public key to this somebody else's public key
00:05:01.970 You'll notice this little blue box around the from public key that
00:05:07.400 suggests that
00:05:08.930 You can check this signature against this public key to see whether or not the private key behind, this public key
00:05:17.660 actually sign this message
00:05:18.940 so let's hit verify sure enough it verifies so I know that the person in possession with the
00:05:26.389 Private key behind this public key must only beyonders is sending twenty dollars
00:05:32.840 To some other public key, okay, now, let's use this in the blockchain
00:05:40.040 Let's go back to the blockchain case where we were that we're looking at before now
00:05:44.890 You'll notice a couple of different things here all right first of all
00:05:49.940 There's not names here anymore right there
00:05:52.750 There are just public keys in the from and the two and you'll also notice that that I added a signature
00:05:59.870 section here, okay, so
00:06:03.380 In this case this is this
00:06:07.130 Public key sending two dollars to this public key
00:06:11.260 And here's a message signature that says that it is well
00:06:14.680 What happens if I change this to you know 25 dollars okay?
00:06:19.180 Of course it broke the block
00:06:20.990 But it also broke the signature the signature is not verified and that's why the signature is turning red so Wow?
00:06:29.320 we couldn't press the little mine button you know a miner could take this altered block and
00:06:36.050 Remind this block
00:06:38.200 They're gonna end up with something where the block is signed
00:06:43.180 which should eventually happen and
00:06:46.030 there we go and
00:06:48.190 the signature though is still
00:06:51.100 invalid because the the minor has no they don't have my
00:06:56.350 Private key, they only have my public key, so they can't come up with the right signature. Okay, so that's the way
00:07:02.830 We can make sure that
00:07:04.570 The message this transaction here was posed
00:07:08.320 By the person that had the money and only that person not just anyone else on on the Internet
00:07:15.690 So that's how public private key pair
00:07:19.240 Message signing is used to protect
00:07:22.960 transactions and make sure that they are
00:07:25.660 from the people that they
00:07:27.670 proposed that they're from
00:07:30.130 Now if you think about it it actually works really well because in order to create a new
00:07:36.820 address a new public key the only thing you have to do is go back and
00:07:42.700 Come up with a new private key a new random number. You didn't have to go to a centralized Authority to
00:07:51.460 come up with a
00:07:54.610 Public/private key pair, you know you just make up a private key
00:07:58.140 And you use it you derive the public key from it and you put that out there
00:08:02.160 And and that's how people can pay you so
00:08:06.520 That's a blockchain and again. It's it's a financial context all successful production block chains that are
00:08:14.680 Distributed use a token of some sort so they did they're all they'll have a financial
00:08:20.470 context so that's
00:08:22.660 You know how a blockchain?
00:08:24.880 Will will work I mean I have glossed over a couple of
00:08:29.500 the details
00:08:30.540 But for the most part the the overall idea here that you're looking at is is very similar to the way that
00:08:38.260 Bitcoin works
00:08:39.580 And many other cryptocurrencies as well, so that's a blockchain. I hope it's helpful to you
00:08:45.450 please leave me some notes down below and let me know what you think of this and
00:08:50.290 I hope to see you next time in the next video
