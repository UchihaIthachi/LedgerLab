Each peer maintains their own copy of this ledger.\nLook at Peer X's first block to see example transactions. While some blockchains use a 'Coinbase' transaction to mint new currency as a block reward, the blocks on this specific '/tokens' page are designed to focus purely on the transfer of existing tokens; thus, they do not create new currency via coinbase transactions.",
